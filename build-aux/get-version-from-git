## I wrote this simple ad-hoc script from scratch instead of reusing
## git-version-gen from GNUlib, which is very sensitive to tag names.

## In this version .tarball-version is supposed to be written manually.

#git_command_line='git describe --long --always --all --dirty'
git_command_line='git describe --always --dirty --tags'
export git_command_line

# The output has no trailing newline: it's intended to be used from m4.

if test -e .tarball-version; then
  if test -e .version \
     && $git_command_line > /dev/null 2> /dev/null \
     && test "$($git_command_line)" != "$(cat .version)"; then
    echo 'ERROR: you should update or delete .tarball-version' 2> /dev/stderr
    exit 1
  else
    printf "%s" "$(cat .tarball-version)"
  fi
elif $git_command_line > .version 2> /dev/null ; then
  printf "git-%s" "$(cat .version)"
else
  echo 'unknown' > .version
  printf "git-%s" "$(cat .version)"
fi
