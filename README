Quick start
-----------

Due to my horrible abuse of Scheme macros epsilon bootstrap faster with Guile
version 1 than with Guile version 2; with Guile 2 you need to disable the
bytecode compiler; building and running the REPL thru make automatically do
this.

I currently recommend running the epsilon1 repl thru make, from the build
directory.  Just run:

  make repl

.  This will bootstrap from Scheme and/or unexec the needed images, then start a
native epsilon interactive REPL.

Sometimes you may want to run a REPL without rebuilding it, which is to say
ignoring its build dependencies.  In order to do this, just run

  make quick-repl
.


A few notes about running the epsilon or Scheme REPLs without make
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is tricky, and the interface will change in the future.  You probably don't
need this, and this information may rapidly get out of date.

The Scheme files in bootstrap/scheme depend on guile+whatever.
When linked against Guile 2.x, guile+whatever should always be called *with* the option
--no-auto-compile .  Setting the stack size to unlimited is probably needed as well (under
GNU Bash, run

  ulimit -s unlimited

in the interactive shell before launching guile+whatever).  You may also need to make the
Scheme stack bigger if using Guile 2 to bootstrap, by setting the environment variable
GUILE2_STACK_SIZE.
